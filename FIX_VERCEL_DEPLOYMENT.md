# Fixing Vercel Deployment Issues with Prisma

## Problem Summary

The deployment is failing because the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not available during the Vercel build process, but the build script is trying to run database operations that require this variable.

## Root Cause

The error occurs because:
1. The build process runs `prisma generate && prisma db push && npm run db:seed && next build`
2. `prisma db push` requires a database connection via `DATABASE_URL`
3. During Vercel build time, environment variables are not yet available
4. This causes the Prisma schema validation to fail

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Build Process

We've created a custom build script (`scripts/vercel-build.js`) that:
- Only runs `prisma generate` and `next build` during the build phase
- Avoids database operations that require a connection during build time

### 2. Environment Variable Handling

We've updated `vercel.json` to properly configure environment variables:
- Explicitly defines required environment variables
- Uses the `@variable_name` syntax to reference Vercel project settings

### 3. Prisma Client Robustness

We've updated `lib/prisma.ts` to handle cases where the Prisma client cannot be initialized:
- Gracefully handles missing environment variables
- Provides mock implementations for build time
- Ensures the application can still build even without database access

## Required Actions in Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
3. Add the following environment variables:
   - `database_url` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
   - `nextauth_secret` - A 32+ character random string
   - `nextauth_url` - Your production URL (e.g., https://your-project.vercel.app)

## Post-Deployment Database Setup

After successful deployment, you'll need to set up your database:

1. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

2. Seed the database with initial data:
   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer to keep the database operations in the build process, you can:

1. Use Vercel's [Build Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#build-environment-variables) to provide a temporary database connection during build
2. Set up a separate build database that's accessible during the build process

However, the approach we've implemented is recommended as it:
- Separates build-time concerns from runtime concerns
- Reduces build time by avoiding database operations
- Makes the build process more reliable
- Follows best practices for CI/CD deployments

## Testing the Fix

To test locally:
1. Ensure you have the required environment variables in your `.env.local` file
2. Run `npm run build` to verify the build process works without database access
3. Run `npm run dev` to test the application with database access

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Verify all environment variables are correctly set in the Vercel dashboard
2. Check that your database URL is properly formatted
3. Ensure your database is accessible from Vercel (firewall settings)
4. Confirm that the database credentials are correct
