# Tailwind CSS Build Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The project was experiencing a build error related to Tailwind CSS configuration:
```
Error: It looks like you're trying to use `tailwindcss` directly as a PostCSS plugin. The PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package, so to continue using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS you'll need to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` and update your PostCSS configuration.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because Tailwind CSS v4 moved the PostCSS plugin to a separate package. The project was still using the old configuration that referenced the `tailwindcss` plugin directly in the PostCSS configuration, but the dependencies had been updated to include `@tailwindcss/postcss`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated PostCSS Configuration (`postcss.config.mjs`)
Changed from:
```javascript
plugins: {
  tailwindcss: {},
  autoprefixer: {},
}
```

To:
```javascript
plugins: {
  '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
  autoprefixer: {},
}
```

### 2. Updated Tailwind Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)
Made a minor update to the content paths to ensure proper file detection:
- Added `./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}` to the content array
- Kept existing paths for backward compatibility

## Verification
The fix has been implemented and the build process has been initiated to verify the solution. The changes align with Tailwind CSS v4 requirements and should resolve the build error.

## Additional Notes
- The project already had the correct dependencies installed (`@tailwindcss/postcss` and `tailwindcss`)
- No changes were needed to the CSS files as they were already correctly configured
- The fix follows the official Tailwind CSS v4 migration guide
