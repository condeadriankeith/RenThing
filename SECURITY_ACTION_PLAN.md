# Security Action Plan

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate All Exposed Keys
- [ ] Rotate Supabase API key
- [ ] Reset Supabase database password
- [ ] Rotate any other potentially exposed keys
- [ ] Update all environment variables with new keys

### 2. Audit Recent Activity
- [ ] Check Supabase logs for unauthorized access
- [ ] Review database access logs
- [ ] Monitor payment services for unauthorized transactions
- [ ] Check application logs for suspicious activity

### 3. Update Production Systems
- [ ] Deploy updated code to production
- [ ] Update environment variables in production
- [ ] Verify all services are working correctly with new keys

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented the following security measures:

### Files Updated
1. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID.md** - Updated with correct Supabase configuration
2. **.gitignore** - Enhanced to properly ignore sensitive files
3. **.env.example** - Created template for environment variables
4. **SECURITY.md** - Added security policy and best practices
5. **scripts/rotate-keys.js** - Added helper script for key rotation

### Files Restored
1. **app/notes/page.tsx** - Restored page that uses Supabase
2. **utils/supabase/server.ts** - Restored Supabase utility file
3. **@supabase/supabase-js** - Restored Supabase dependency in package.json

### Security Enhancements
1. **Environment Variable Management**
   - All sensitive data now uses environment variables
   - Created `.env.example` as a template
   - Updated `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

2. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive security policy
   - Created key rotation helper script
   - Updated existing documentation to reflect best practices

3. **Prevention Measures**
   - Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future leaks
   - Added security notes to relevant files
   - Created template for proper environment variable usage

## Ongoing Security Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
2. Never commit actual secrets to version control
3. Regularly audit code for hardcoded credentials
4. Use the `.env.example` template for new developers

### Monitoring
1. Regularly check GitGuardian alerts
2. Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
3. Periodically rotate keys as a best practice
4. Review access logs for all services

### Team Practices
1. Educate all team members on security best practices
2. Implement code review processes to catch security issues
3. Use secret scanning tools in the development pipeline
4. Establish incident response procedures

## Key Rotation Instructions

### Supabase
1. Log into Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Generate new service role key
4. Update environment variables with new key
5. Revoke old key

### Database
1. If using Supabase, reset database password
2. Update DATABASE_URL environment variable
3. Verify application connectivity

### Authentication
1. Generate new NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
   ```
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
2. Update environment variables
3. Restart application

### Payment Services
1. Log into Stripe/Xendit dashboard
2. Rotate API keys
3. Update environment variables
4. Test payment functionality

## Verification Steps

After implementing all changes:

1. [ ] Verify application builds successfully
2. [ ] Test all application functionality
3. [ ] Confirm database connectivity
4. [ ] Test authentication
5. [ ] Verify payment processing
6. [ ] Check that no sensitive data is exposed in the codebase
7. [ ] Confirm GitGuardian no longer detects exposed secrets

## Additional Recommendations

### For Vercel Deployments
1. Use Vercel's secrets management:
   ```
   vercel secrets add supabase-key your-supabase-key
   vercel env add SUPABASE_KEY @supabase-key
   ```

### For Team Collaboration
1. Share `.env.example` with team members
2. Never share actual environment files
3. Use secure methods to distribute sensitive information
4. Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of secrets

### Continuous Security
1. Regularly update dependencies
2. Implement automated security scanning
3. Conduct periodic security audits
4. Stay informed about security best practices
