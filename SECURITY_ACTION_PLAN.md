# Security Action Plan

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Rotate All Exposed Keys
- [ ] Rotate any potentially exposed keys (check logs for unauthorized access)
- [ ] Update all environment variables with new keys

### 2. Audit Recent Activity
- [ ] Check application logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Monitor payment services for unauthorized transactions
- [ ] Check database access logs if available

### 3. Update Production Systems
- [ ] Deploy updated code to production
- [ ] Update environment variables in production
- [ ] Verify all services are working correctly with new configuration

## Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented the following security measures:

### Files Updated
1. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID.md** - Redacted sensitive information
2. **.gitignore** - Enhanced to properly ignore sensitive files
3. **.env.example** - Created template for environment variables
4. **SECURITY.md** - Added security policy and best practices
5. **scripts/rotate-keys.js** - Added helper script for key rotation

### Files Removed
1. **app/notes/page.tsx** - Removed page that depended on Supabase
2. **utils/supabase/server.ts** - Removed Supabase utility file
3. **utils/supabase/** - Removed entire Supabase directory
4. **@supabase/supabase-js** - Removed Supabase dependency from package.json

### Security Enhancements
1. **Environment Variable Management**
   - All sensitive data now uses environment variables
   - Created `.env.example` as a template
   - Updated `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

2. **Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive security policy
   - Created key rotation helper script
   - Updated existing documentation to reflect best practices

3. **Prevention Measures**
   - Enhanced `.gitignore` to prevent future leaks
   - Added security notes to relevant files
   - Created template for proper environment variable usage

## Ongoing Security Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Always use environment variables for sensitive data
2. Never commit actual secrets to version control
3. Regularly audit code for hardcoded credentials
4. Use the `.env.example` template for new developers

### Monitoring
1. Regularly check security alerts
2. Monitor application logs for suspicious activity
3. Periodically rotate keys as a best practice
4. Review access logs for all services

### Team Practices
1. Educate all team members on security best practices
2. Implement code review processes to catch security issues
3. Use secret scanning tools in the development pipeline
4. Establish incident response procedures

## Verification Steps

After implementing all changes:

1. [ ] Verify application builds successfully
2. [ ] Test all application functionality
3. [ ] Confirm database connectivity
4. [ ] Test authentication
5. [ ] Verify payment processing
6. [ ] Check that no sensitive data is exposed in the codebase
7. [ ] Confirm no security alerts are triggered

## Additional Recommendations

### For Vercel Deployments
1. Use Vercel's secrets management for sensitive data

### For Team Collaboration
1. Share `.env.example` with team members
2. Never share actual environment files
3. Use secure methods to distribute sensitive information
4. Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of secrets

### Continuous Security
1. Regularly update dependencies
2. Implement automated security scanning
3. Conduct periodic security audits
4. Stay informed about security best practices
