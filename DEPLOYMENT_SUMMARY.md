- Proper error handling for database connection issues

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set up Vercel Postgres database
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (random 32+ character string)
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (your Vercel deployment URL)
3. Deploy to Vercel
4. Verify deployment with test scripts:
   - `npm run test:db` - Test database connection
   - `npm run test:login` - Test admin login
   - `npm run test:listing` - Test listing creation

## Testing Credentials

After successful deployment, you can use these credentials:

### Admin User
- Email: admin@renthing.com
- Password: admin123

### Vendor User
- Email: vendor@renthing.com
- Password: vendor123

### Regular User
- Email: user@renthing.com
- Password: user123

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the PostgreSQL database is properly configured
4. Run the test scripts to identify specific issues:
   - `npm run test:db`
   - `npm run test:login`
   - `npm run test:listing`
