# Ollama Integration Summary

## Overview

We have successfully integrated Ollama as a locally hosted AI model for the RenThing platform. This provides an alternative to the OpenRouter API for running the AI assistant locally.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Code Changes

We modified the `RenAIService` class in `lib/ai/ren-ai-service.ts` to:

1. Add a new `processWithOllama` method that handles communication with the Ollama API
2. Update the `processMessage` method to prioritize Ollama as the first option, followed by OpenRouter, and finally the rule-based system as a fallback

### 2. Environment Configuration

We updated the environment configuration files to include Ollama settings:

- `.env.local` - For local development
- `.env.example` - Template for new installations
- `.env.production` - For production deployments (Ollama disabled by default)

### 3. Documentation

We created comprehensive documentation:
- `OLLAMA_INTEGRATION.md` - Detailed setup and usage instructions
- This summary file

## How It Works

The AI service now follows this priority order:

1. **Ollama** (if enabled) - Uses your locally hosted model
2. **OpenRouter** (fallback) - Uses the DeepSeek API through OpenRouter
3. **Rule-based system** (final fallback) - Uses built-in responses for basic queries

## Benefits

- **Privacy**: All data stays on your local machine
- **Cost**: No API costs since you're hosting the model yourself
- **Control**: Full control over the model and its responses
- **Offline capability**: Works without an internet connection

## Testing

We created a test endpoint at `/api/test-ollama` that demonstrates the integration working correctly. The test shows that:

1. The system correctly detects Ollama configuration
2. It successfully communicates with the Ollama API
3. It receives and processes responses from the local model
4. The response is properly formatted and returned to the client

## Model Used

We're using the `llama3.1:8b` model, which provides a good balance between performance and resource requirements.

## Configuration

To enable Ollama integration, set these environment variables:

```env
OLLAMA_ENABLED=true
OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for streaming responses from Ollama
2. Implement model selection based on task type
3. Add performance monitoring for local model processing
4. Implement caching for common queries to reduce processing time
