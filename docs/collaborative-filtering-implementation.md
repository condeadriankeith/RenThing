# Collaborative Filtering Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of collaborative filtering recommendations in the REN AI system. The feature provides personalized recommendations based on the principle that users who rented similar items in the past will have similar preferences in the future.

## Implementation Details

### Algorithm Approach
The collaborative filtering implementation uses a user-based collaborative filtering approach with the following steps:

1. **User Similarity Calculation**: Identify users who have rented similar items to the target user
2. **Recommendation Generation**: Find items rented by similar users that the target user hasn't rented
3. **Scoring and Ranking**: Score recommendations based on multiple factors and rank them

### Key Features

#### 1. User Similarity Detection
- Identifies users who have rented the same items as the target user
- Calculates similarity scores based on the proportion of shared items
- Limits results to the most similar users for performance

#### 2. Recommendation Scoring
Recommendations are scored based on multiple factors:
- **User Similarity Score**: Base score from similar users who rented the item
- **Category Match Bonus**: Additional points for items in categories the user prefers
- **Popularity Bonus**: Points based on how many similar users rented the item
- **Rating Bonus**: Points based on the item's average rating

#### 3. Personalization Features
- Category-based recommendations aligned with user preferences
- Rating-weighted suggestions for higher quality items
- Source tracking to understand why an item was recommended

### Data Sources
- User booking history
- Listing categories and metadata
- Item ratings and reviews
- User preference data

### Scoring Algorithm
The recommendation score is calculated as:
```
Final Score = Base Score + Category Bonus + Popularity Bonus + Rating Bonus

Where:
- Base Score = Number of similar users who rented the item × 10
- Category Bonus = 20 points if item category matches user preferences
- Popularity Bonus = Minimum of (Number of similar users × 2, 15)
- Rating Bonus = Average rating × 3
```

## Integration Points
- Recommendation engine API
- User booking history database
- Listing metadata system
- Review and rating system

## Performance Considerations
- Limits similar users to top 20 for performance
- Limits final recommendations to top 10
- Uses database-level aggregation for efficient similarity calculation

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with item-based collaborative filtering
- Real-time similarity updates
- Hybrid approach combining collaborative and content-based filtering
- Machine learning models for improved similarity calculations
- Cold start problem solutions for new users
