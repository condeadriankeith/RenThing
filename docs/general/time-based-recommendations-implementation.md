# Time-Based Recommendations Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of time-based recommendations for the REN AI assistant. This feature enhances personalization by providing suggestions based on the user's preferred booking days and hours, as well as general time-of-day patterns.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced User Preferences Model
- Added `preferredBookingDays` field to store user's preferred booking days
- Added `preferredBookingHours` field to store user's preferred booking hours
- Updated Prisma schema to include these new fields

### 2. Profile Settings UI
- Added UI controls for users to select their preferred booking days
- Added UI controls for users to select their preferred booking hours
- Integrated time-based preferences into the save/load workflow

### 3. AI Service Enhancements
- Updated `getExplicitUserPreferences` method to retrieve time-based preferences
- Updated `updateExplicitUserPreferences` method to save time-based preferences
- Updated `getUserPreferences` method to combine explicit and implicit time-based preferences
- Enhanced `getContextualSuggestions` method to provide time-based suggestions

### 4. API Integration
- Updated API routes to handle time-based preference data
- Ensured proper data serialization/deserialization for time-based preferences

## Technical Details

### Data Model
The UserPreferences model was extended with two new fields:
```prisma
model UserPreferences {
  // ... existing fields ...
  preferredBookingDays   String?  // JSON array of preferred days (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
  preferredBookingHours  String?  // JSON array of preferred hours (0-23)
}
```

### Preference Combination Logic
The system combines explicit and implicit preferences:
1. Explicit preferences take precedence over implicit ones
2. If a user has set preferred booking days/hours, those are used
3. If not, the system falls back to inferred preferences
4. If neither is available, it defaults to empty arrays

### Time-Based Suggestions
The AI service now provides enhanced time-based suggestions:
1. **Personalized Time Suggestions**: If the current hour matches a user's preferred booking hours, a special suggestion is shown
2. **Day-Based Suggestions**: If the current day matches a user's preferred booking days, a special suggestion is shown
3. **General Time-Based Suggestions**: 
   - Evening hours (18-24): "List an item for rent"
   - Business hours (9-17): "Browse items for your next project"
4. **Weekend/Weekday Specials**: Different suggestions for weekends vs weekdays

### UI Implementation
The profile settings page was enhanced with:
1. **Preferred Booking Days Section**: Checkboxes for each day of the week
2. **Preferred Booking Hours Section**: Checkboxes for each hour of the day (0-23)
3. **Responsive Design**: Grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes

## Files Modified

1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added time-based preference fields
2. `lib/ai/ren-ai-service.ts` - Enhanced preference handling and time-based suggestions
3. `lib/ai/ren-ai-service-client.ts` - Updated AIContext interface
4. `app/profile/settings/page.tsx` - Added UI controls for time-based preferences
5. `app/api/ai/preferences/route.ts` - API route (already compatible with new structure)
6. `REN_AI_Todo_List.md` - Updated to mark task as complete

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Personalization**: Users receive more relevant suggestions based on their preferred booking times
2. **Improved User Experience**: More contextually appropriate recommendations
3. **Increased Engagement**: Better timing of suggestions may lead to higher conversion rates
4. **Flexible Preferences**: Users can specify detailed time preferences that match their schedules

## Future Improvements

1. **Inferred Time Preferences**: Implement analysis of user behavior to infer preferred booking times
2. **Time Zone Support**: Add time zone awareness for users in different locations
3. **Advanced Scheduling**: Integrate with calendar systems for more sophisticated time-based suggestions
4. **Notification Timing**: Use time preferences to optimize notification delivery times

## Testing

The implementation was verified by:
1. Checking that the Prisma schema updates correctly
2. Verifying that the profile settings UI saves and loads time-based preferences
3. Confirming that the AI service properly incorporates time-based preferences into suggestions
4. Ensuring the API routes handle time-based preference data correctly

## Conclusion

The time-based recommendations feature has been successfully implemented, enhancing REN's ability to provide personalized, time-aware suggestions to users. The implementation is flexible, allowing users to specify detailed time preferences while maintaining backward compatibility for users who haven't set these preferences.
