- Created support scripts for reintegration and removal
- Generated summary documentation for the reorganization

## Files and Directories Created

### Isolation Directory
- `ren-ai/` - Main directory containing all isolated REN AI files

### Support Scripts
- `reintegrate-ren-ai.ps1` - Script to reintegrate files back to original locations
- `remove-ren-ai-isolation.ps1` - Script to remove the isolated directory

### Documentation
- `REN_AI_ISOLATION_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of isolated files and structure
- `PROJECT_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete overview of the reorganization
- `TASK_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Verification Process

1. **File Identification**: Identified all files related to REN AI across the project
2. **Commit Verification**: Verified commit details and file versions
3. **File Isolation**: Moved all REN AI files to the isolated directory
4. **Implementation Check**: Ensured all isolated files match the commit version
5. **Directory Structure**: Created a logical organization for the isolated files
6. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for the changes
7. **Support Tools**: Created scripts to assist with future reintegration

## Next Steps

The REN AI files are now properly isolated and organized. The project is ready for:
1. Focused development on REN AI features within the isolated directory
2. Easy reintegration of files when development is complete
3. Clean removal of isolated files when they're no longer needed
=======
1. Remove all files that relate to REN AI from the project
2. Remove all AI integration components including Ollama and OpenRouter
3. Update documentation to reflect the removal of AI features
4. Verify that all AI-related files have been properly removed

## Completed Tasks

### 1. REN AI File Removal ✅
- Completely removed the `ren-ai` directory and all its contents
- Removed all AI-related files from the codebase
- Verified that no AI components remain in the application

### 2. AI Integration Removal ✅
- Removed all Ollama integration components

- Removed all AI-specific documentation files

### 4. Verification Process ✅
- Verified complete removal of all AI-related directories
- Verified complete removal of all AI-related files
- Verified updates to documentation files
- Verified no remaining references to AI services in the codebase

## Files and Directories Removed

### AI Directories
- `ren-ai/` - Main directory containing all REN AI files
- `app/api/ai/` - AI API routes
- `app/api/test-ollama/` - Ollama test API routes
- `components/ai/` - AI React components
- `__tests__/ai/` - AI-related test files
- `app/ai-demo/` - AI demonstration page

### AI Files
