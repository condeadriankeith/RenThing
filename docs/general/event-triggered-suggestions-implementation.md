# Event-Triggered Suggestions Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of event-triggered suggestions in the REN AI system. The feature provides personalized, context-aware suggestions based on user actions, behavior patterns, and workflow states.

## Implementation Details

### Event Detection
The system detects various user events and behaviors through:

1. **Action Tracking**: Monitoring user actions taken during the current session
2. **Workflow State**: Tracking user progress through multi-step processes
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Analyzing sequences of actions to infer user intent
4. **Abandoned Workflows**: Detecting when users start but don't complete processes

### Event Types

#### 1. Session-Based Events
- Multiple listing views (suggest saving to wishlist)
- Repeated searches (suggest refining search)
- Listing page visits (suggest booking or asking questions)

#### 2. Workflow Events
- Booking workflow steps (date selection, payment, confirmation)
- Listing creation steps (item details, photos, availability)
- Search refinement steps (filters, sorting, saving)

#### 3. Behavioral Events
- Booking-related research patterns
- Listing creation research patterns
- Abandoned booking processes
- Abandoned listing processes

#### 4. Personalized Events
- Rental history-based suggestions
- Complementary item recommendations
- Maintenance reminders for listed items

### Personalization Algorithm
The system enhances event-triggered suggestions with personalization by:

1. **Rental History Analysis**: Examining past bookings to suggest related items
2. **Listing Analysis**: Reviewing user's listed items for maintenance suggestions
3. **Category Matching**: Identifying complementary items based on categories
4. **Contextual Recommendations**: Providing relevant suggestions based on current activity

### Data Sources
- Current session actions
- Conversation state and workflow progress
- User rental history
- User listed items
- User preferences and persona data

## Integration Points
- Contextual suggestions API endpoint
- User session tracking
- Workflow management system
- Rental history database
- Listing management system

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning models for improved event detection
- Real-time event processing
- Cross-session behavior analysis
- Integration with external calendar events
- A/B testing for suggestion effectiveness
