## Architecture

The implementation follows a modular architecture:

```
lib/ai/                 # Core AI logic and services
components/ai/          # Reusable UI components
app/api/ai/             # API routes for AI functionality
hooks/                  # Custom hooks for AI integration
__tests__/              # Unit tests for AI components
```

## Testing

Unit tests have been created for:
- Core AI service functionality
- Mascot component rendering and interactions

## Next Steps

To fully implement REN's capabilities, the following enhancements could be made:

1. **LLM Integration**: Connect to OpenAI or similar service for advanced natural language processing
2. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML models for better recommendations
3. **Voice Features**: Add voice-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
4. **AR Integration**: Implement augmented reality features for the mascot
5. **Advanced System Monitoring**: Implement actual GitHub integration for code scanning
6. **Multilingual Support**: Expand beyond English and Filipino

## Recent Enhancements

1. **Ollama Integration**: Enhanced support for locally hosted AI models through Ollama for improved privacy and control.

## Usage

To use REN in the application:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit the demo page: `http://localhost:3000/ai-demo`
3. Interact with the chat interface and recommendations
4. Integrate components into other pages using the integration guide
