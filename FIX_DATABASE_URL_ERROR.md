# Fixing "DATABASE_URL references Secret database_url, which does not exist" Error

## Problem

Your Vercel deployment is failing with the error:
```
Environment Variable "DATABASE_URL" references Secret "database_url", which does not exist.
```

This happens because your `vercel.json` file is configured to use a Vercel secret named `database_url`, but this secret hasn't been created in your Vercel project settings.

## Solution

You need to create the missing secret in your Vercel dashboard. Here's how:

### Step 1: Create a Database

First, you need a PostgreSQL database. Here are some recommended options:

#### Option 1: Neon (Recommended - Free Tier Available)
1. Go to https://neon.tech
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Copy the connection string (it will look like `postgresql://username:password@host.region.neon.tech/database_name`)

#### Option 2: Supabase (Database Only)
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create a new project
3. Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Database"
4. Copy the connection string under "Connection Info"

### Step 2: Add the Secret to Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" in the top navigation
3. Select "Environment Variables" from the sidebar
4. Click "Add"
5. Fill in the form:
   - **Key**: `database_url` (this must match exactly)
   - **Value**: Your PostgreSQL connection string from Step 1
   - **Environment**: Select "Production" (you can also select "Preview" if needed)
6. Click "Add"

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go back to your project dashboard
2. Click on the "Deployments" tab
3. Find your latest deployment
4. Click the "Redeploy" button
5. Make sure to check "Use existing Build Cache" to speed up the process

## Verification

After redeploying, the error should be resolved. You can verify this by:

1. Checking the deployment logs - the error should no longer appear
2. Visiting your deployed site to ensure it loads correctly
3. Testing database-dependent features like user registration or listing creation

## Alternative Solution: Change vercel.json Configuration

If you prefer not to use Vercel secrets, you can modify the `vercel.json` file to use direct environment variable values:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": [
          "prisma/**"
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "your-postgresql-connection-string-here",
    "NEXTAUTH_SECRET": "your-nextauth-secret-here",
    "NEXTAUTH_URL": "https://your-domain.vercel.app"
  }
}
```

**Warning**: This approach is less secure as the database URL will be visible in your repository. It's recommended to use Vercel secrets instead.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Double-check the secret name**: It must be exactly `database_url` (case-sensitive)
2. **Verify your connection string**: Make sure it's a valid PostgreSQL connection string
3. **Check database accessibility**: Ensure your database accepts connections from Vercel
4. **Confirm environment selection**: Make sure you added the secret to the "Production" environment
